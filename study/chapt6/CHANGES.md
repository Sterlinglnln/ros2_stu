# Fishbot Gazebo Harmonic Integration - Changes Summary

## Problem
The fishbot robot needed to be controllable in Gazebo Harmonic through proper topic mapping.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Missing Dependencies (package.xml)
Added the following dependencies required for Gazebo Harmonic integration:
- `ros_gz_sim` - For spawning models in Gazebo
- `ros_gz_bridge` - For bridging ROS 2 and Gazebo topics
- `robot_state_publisher` - For publishing robot state
- `xacro` - For processing URDF files

### 2. Created worlds Directory
Created the `worlds/` directory that was referenced in CMakeLists.txt but didn't exist.

### 3. Fixed Topic Bridge Mapping (gz_sim.launch.py)
**Before:**
- ROS 2 topics: `/model/fishbot/cmd_vel` and `/model/fishbot/odometry`
- Gazebo topics: `/model/fishbot/cmd_vel` and `/model/fishbot/odometry`

**After:**
- ROS 2 topics: `/cmd_vel` and `/odometry` (user-friendly)
- Gazebo topics: `/model/fishbot/cmd_vel` and `/model/fishbot/odometry` (Gazebo Harmonic standard)

This change allows users to publish velocity commands to the standard `/cmd_vel` topic instead of the full `/model/fishbot/cmd_vel` path, making it more intuitive and consistent with typical ROS 2 robot control patterns.

### 4. Updated .gitignore
Added Python cache file patterns (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `*.pyo`) to prevent accidental commits.

## How It Works

1. **xacro → URDF**: The launch file processes the fishbot xacro file into URDF format
2. **URDF → SDF**: Converts URDF to Gazebo SDF format
3. **Plugin Injection**: Injects the DiffDrive plugin with proper configuration for wheel joints and parameters
4. **Model Spawning**: Spawns the robot model in Gazebo Harmonic
5. **Topic Bridging**: Bridges ROS 2 topics to Gazebo topics:
   - `/cmd_vel` (ROS 2) ↔ `/model/fishbot/cmd_vel` (Gazebo)
   - `/odometry` (ROS 2) ↔ `/model/fishbot/odometry` (Gazebo)
6. **State Publishing**: Publishes robot state for visualization in RViz

## Usage

To launch the simulation:
```bash
ros2 launch fishbot_description gz_sim.launch.py
```

To control the robot:
```bash
ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 0.5}, angular: {z: 0.0}}"
```

To view odometry:
```bash
ros2 topic echo /odometry
```
